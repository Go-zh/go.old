// The guintptr, muintptr, and puintptr are all used to bypass write barriers.
// It is particularly important to avoid write barriers when the current P has
// been released, because the GC thinks the world is stopped, and an
// unexpected write barrier would not be synchronized with the GC,
// which can lead to a half-executed write barrier that has marked the object
// but not queued it. If the GC skips the object and completes before the
// queuing can occur, it will incorrectly free the object.
//
// We tried using special assignment functions invoked only when not
// holding a running P, but then some updates to a particular memory
// word went through write barriers and some did not. This breaks the
// write barrier shadow checking mode, and it is also scary: better to have
// a word that is completely ignored by the GC than to have one for which
// only a few updates are ignored.
//
// Gs, Ms, and Ps are always reachable via true pointers in the
// allgs, allm, and allp lists or (during allocation before they reach those lists)
// from stack variables.

// A guintptr holds a goroutine pointer, but typed as a uintptr
// to bypass write barriers. It is used in the Gobuf goroutine state
// and in scheduling lists that are manipulated without a P.
//
// The Gobuf.g goroutine pointer is almost always updated by assembly code.
// In one of the few places it is updated by Go code - func save - it must be
// treated as a uintptr to avoid a write barrier being emitted at a bad time.
// Instead of figuring out how to emit the write barriers missing in the
// assembly manipulation, we change the type of the field to uintptr,
// so that it does not require write barriers at all.
//
// Goroutine structs are published in the allg list and never freed.
// That will keep the goroutine structs from being collected.
// There is never a time that Gobuf.g's contain the only references
// to a goroutine: the publishing of the goroutine in allg comes first.
// Goroutine pointers are also kept in non-GC-visible places like TLS,
// so I can't see them ever moving. If we did want to start moving data
// in the GC, we'd need to allocate the goroutine structs from an
// alternate arena. Using guintptr doesn't make that problem any worse.
