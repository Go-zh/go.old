# See golang.org/s/go15bootstrap for an overview of the build process.

# Environment variables that control make.bash:
#
# GOROOT_FINAL: The expected final Go root, baked into binaries.
# The default is the location of the Go tree during the build.
#
# GOHOSTARCH: The architecture for host tools (compilers and
# binaries).  Binaries of this type must be executable on the current
# system, so the only common reason to set this is to set
# GOHOSTARCH=386 on an amd64 machine.
#
# GOARCH: The target architecture for installed packages and tools.
#
# GOOS: The target operating system for installed packages and tools.
#
# GO_GCFLAGS: Additional go tool compile arguments to use when
# building the packages and commands.
#
# GO_LDFLAGS: Additional go tool link arguments to use when
# building the commands.
#
# CGO_ENABLED: Controls cgo usage during the build. Set it to 1
# to include all cgo related files, .c and .go file with "cgo"
# build directive, in the build. Set it to 0 to ignore them.
#
# GO_EXTLINK_ENABLED: Set to 1 to invoke the host linker when building
# packages that use cgo.  Set to 0 to do all linking internally.  This
# controls the default behavior of the linker's -linkmode option.  The
# default value depends on the system.
#
# CC: Command line to run to compile C code for GOHOSTARCH.
# Default is "gcc". Also supported: "clang".
#
# CC_FOR_TARGET: Command line to run to compile C code for GOARCH.
# This is used by cgo.  Default is CC.
#
# CXX_FOR_TARGET: Command line to run to compile C++ code for GOARCH.
# This is used by cgo. Default is CXX, or, if that is not set, 
# "g++" or "clang++".
#
# FC: Command line to run to compile Fortran code for GOARCH.
# This is used by cgo. Default is "gfortran".
#
# GO_DISTFLAGS: extra flags to provide to "dist bootstrap".
